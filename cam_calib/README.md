# Camera calibration
- Camera intrinsic matrix is:
```
[[699.78, 0.0, 660.19],
[0.0, 699.78, 365.3615],
[0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]
```
It can be accessed from [ZED calibration file](http://calib.stereolabs.com/?SN=17471) (SN:17471, the left view camera, images are in `rgbd0` folder). We use the `LEFT_CAM_HD` as intrinsics in all our cases. 
- Camera extrinsic matrix could be calculated by 
```python
python cam_calib/annotator_camextr.py --img_file ${YOUR_IMAGE_PATH} --save_folder ${YOUR_SAVE_PATH}
```

`--img_file` is the path of the image to be annotated. 
`--save_folder` is the folder path of the calculated parameters to be saved.

After annotating the ground corners `ABCD` (‚ùóbe sure to follow `ABCD` order), the camera extrinsic parameters (world to camera transformation) will be computed with Perspective-N-Point algorithm. Camera intrinsic matrix `CamIntr.txt` and extrinsic matrix `CamExtr.txt` will be saved in `${YOUR_SAVE_PATH}`.
